    <h1>Walkthrough:</h1>

    <p>
        Meet <strong>Dorothy</strong>, an end-to-end data management system. If you are familiar
        with <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> or
        <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a> then you are already halfway to understanding
        Dorothy. We like to think of Dorothy as a "dataforge", a suite of tools used to version,
        manage and distribute datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within Dorothy, datasets are organized hierarchically, similar to repositories on GitHub. At
        the moment, the homepage of Dorothy's UI is the root of the heirarchy. That's where you are
        now!
    </p>

    <p>
        The next level down are <em>organizations</em>. You can see those listed below, as well as
        an option to create a new organization. The next level down from an organization is a
        <em>dataset</em>. An organization can have any number of datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        The dropdown menu in the sidebar will let you select between existing organizations to view
        it's existing datasets, or create a new one. Once an organization is selected, you can
        create a new datset under that organization with the "Create" button.
